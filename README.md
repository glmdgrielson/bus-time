# Bus Time

This is a Rust library to manage time in only the most useful format known to
humanity: the shifts of the Desert Bus for Hope charity livestream.

## What is Bus Time?

Bus Time is divided into four sets of six hours, dubbed "shifts". Times are
universal, but dependent on the Pacific Standard Time of Canada.

* Zeta Shift starts at 0:00 (12 AM).
* Dawn Guard starts at 6:00 (6 AM).
* Alpha Flight starts at 12:00 (12 PM).
* Night Watch starts at 18:00 (6 PM).

## Why?

...because I like watching Desert Bus and I thought this would be fun?
